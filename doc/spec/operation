database build:

for each line in /usr/ports/INDEX
	create plist for that port
		if old database exists and pkg version is the same
			use plist from old database
		else
			recreate the plist with `make show-plist'
	generate unique id
	store the plist and INDEX line, prepending both with the uniq id
