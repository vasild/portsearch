desired features:

* allow searching for ports that install given file
* do everything that can be done with `make search' in the ports directory
* be as fast as possible
* easy addition of new search and output criteria
* easy addition of new data storage modules. That is - do not rely on specific
  sqlite, mysql or postgres features, even make it as easy as possible to add
  non-SQL databases
