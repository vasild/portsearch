	* ChangeLog:
	Added.

	* Makefile:
	`all' target added to make the FreeBSD port even simpler does the same
	as the build target.

	* display.c, display.h, portsearch.c, portsearch.h:
	Added support for outputting a predefined subset of fields.

	* 1.2.0 released

	* display.c exhaust_fp.c store_txt.c vector.c xlibc.c:
	Fix compilation on 4.x by substituting %zu with %u and a typecast.

	* 1.2.1 released

	* 1.2.2 released

2006-03-27	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* portsearch.c, portsearch.h:
	Added -b option for searching against packing list file's
	basename. Does the same as -f '/file$', I just got tired of typing
	the later.

2006-04-27	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* store_txt.c:
	Bugfix: do not ignore -I option for pfiles.

2006-04-28	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* 1.2.3 released

2006-11-02	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* display.c, display.h, portsearch.c:
	Added new output option: `rawfiles' to request outputting only matched
	pfiles one by line, it makes sense only if used with -f or -b. When it
	is specified any other output options are ignored.

	* portsearch.c:
	Changed -b option to be the same as -f '(^|/)file$' instead of
	-f '/file$'.

	* portsearch.c:
	Added new option -L to mimic -p path -f '.*' -o rawfiles e.g. show all
	pfiles for (usually) one port. Inspired by pkg_info -L pkgname.

	* store_txt.c:
	Optimization: do not load pfiles for ports that have not been matched
	by other search criteria (when there are other criteria than -f). We
	do not care about those pfiles because their ports will not be
	displayed anyway. This prevents loading all pfiles for all ports when
	something like -p path -f '.*' is specified.

2006-11-03	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* portsearch.c:
	Ignore case by default and add -S option to force case sensitivity.

2006-11-07	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* portsearch.c, portsearch.h, store_txt.c:
	Change behavior not to ignore case for pfiles by default because it is
	really very slow. Separate case sensitivity options for pfiles and
	other fields. Now -I requests "ignore case for pfiles" and -S "be case
	sensitive for all fields". The default is to be case sensitive for
	pfiles and not for other fields.

2006-11-08	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* display.c, display.h, portsearch.c, portsearch.h:
	Prefix each filename printed (when rawfiles is on) with port's path
	only if more than one port is found. Added -X option to force previous
	behavior (always print port's path).

2006-11-15	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* 1.3.0 released

2007-08-11	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* portsearch.c, portsearch.h:
	Add support for looking outfields option via the environment.
	Idea and patch from Mike Meyer <mwm@mired.org>, thanks!

2007-08-11	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* 1.3.1 released
