	* ChangeLog:
	added

	* Makefile:
	`all' target added to make the FreeBSD port even simpler does the same
	as the build target

	* display.c, display.h, portsearch.c, portsearch.h:
	added support for outputting a predefined subset of fields

	* 1.2.0 released

	* display.c exhaust_fp.c store_txt.c vector.c xlibc.c:
	fix compilation on 4.x by substituting %zu with %u and a typecast

	* 1.2.1 released

	* 1.2.2 released

2006-03-27	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* portsearch.c, portsearch.h:
	added -b option for searching against packing list file's
	basename. Does the same as -f '/file$', I just got tired of typing
	the later.

2006-04-27	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* store_txt.c:
	bugfix: do not ignore -I option for pfiles

2006-04-28	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* 1.2.3 released

2006-11-02	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* display.c, display.h, portsearch.c:
	added new output option: `rawfiles' to request outputting only matched
	pfiles one by line, it makes sense only if used with -f or -b. When it
	is specified any other output options are ignored.

	* portsearch.c:
	changed -b option to be the same as -f '(^|/)file$' instead of
	-f '/file$'

	* portsearch.c:
	added new option -L to mimic -p path -f '.*' -o rawfiles e.g. show all
	pfiles for (usually) one port. Inspired by pkg_info -L pkgname.

	* store_txt.c:
	optimization: do not load pfiles for ports that have not been matched
	by other search criteria (when there are other criteria than -f). We
	do not care about those pfiles because their ports will not be
	displayed anyway. This prevents loading all pfiles for all ports when
	something like -p path -f '.*' is specified.

2006-11-03	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* portsearch.c:
	ignore case by default and add -S option to force case sensitivity

2006-11-07	Vasil Dimov <vd@FreeBSD.org>

	* portsearch.c, portsearch.h, store_txt.c:
	change behavior not to ignore case for pfiles by default because it is
	really very slow. Separate case sensitivity options for pfiles and
	other fields. Now -I requests "ignore case for pfiles" and -S "be case
	sensitive for all fields". The default is to be case sensitive for
	pfiles and not for other fields.
